intercourse, not a dream, and would then fast for that day.' ""He continued, ""Then we went and visited Umm Salama, and Abd ar-
Rahman asked her about the same matter and she said the same as A'isha
had said. Then we went off until we came to Marwan ibn al-Hakam Abd
ar-Rahman told him what they had both said and Marwan said, 'I swear
to you, Abu Muhammad, you must use the mount which is at the door, and
go to Abu Hurayra, who is on his land at al Aqiq, and tell him this.'
